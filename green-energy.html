      <h1><strong>How to get green energy for your home or business today</strong></h1>


      <p>
      There is a massive list of energy providers out there that claim to be green or provide green energy, though as we have found over our research, this isn't always the case.
      </p>
      <p>
      There are a few simple ways to go green and save money with minimal effort.
      </p>
      <p>
      Getting green energy has never been easier or more affordable.
      </p>
      <h2>The easiest way to go green</h2>
      
      
      <p>
      The simplest way to go green is to change energy providers, choose an energy provider that invests in renewables and offers incentives for customers to be less reliant on grid energy. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Grid energy is the energy every home in Australia uses, and it’s 72% fossil fuel energy, so the more you support companies that invest in renewable energy, the sooner we can remove more fossil fuels from our daily lives.
      </p>
      <p>
      Some of the best companies for green energy are:
      </p>
      <h3><a href="https://diamondenergy.com.au/">Diamond Energy</a></h3>
      
      
      <p>
      Diamond energy invests heavily in renewable energy generators like solar farms and biogas facilities. They claim that for every unit of energy a customer uses, they can produce 187% more green energy.
      </p>
      <p>
      You can check out some of the <a href="https://diamondenergy.com.au/our-generation/">Diamond Energy renewable energy facilities</a> here.
      </p>
      <h3><a href="https://www.enovaenergy.com.au/">Enova Energy</a></h3>
      
      
      <p>
      Only available in NSW and South East QLD, Enova invests heavily into using rooftop solar power on their customers' homes and selling that on to your neighbours. They also team up with Diamond Energy to support their renewable energy facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you live in NSW or QLD and want to support community energy, then Enova could be an excellent choice for your energy.
      </p>
      <h3><a href="https://energylocals.com.au/">Energy Locals</a></h3>
      
      
      <p>
      Energy Locals is a big supporter of sourcing energy from within your community and helping customers install solar. They offer the lowest market price on energy and then charge a membership fee elsewhere to make their money. 
      </p>
      <p>
      An added bonus is all the energy they buy from the fossil fuel grid is offset by purchasing carbon credits.
      </p>
      <h2>Companies to avoid if you want to be green</h2>
      
      
      <p>
      You might be familiar with the term “greenwashing”, which is the practice of companies pretending to be greener than they are. A company might have extensive shiny marketing campaigns to make you believe they are doing more to prevent global warming, but behind the scenes, they rake in massive profits from fossil fuels. 
      </p>
      <p>
      There are a few companies that might seem like they are doing more to provide green energy than they are. Here are some of the biggest polluters in Australia.
      </p>
      <h3>AGL</h3>
      
      
      <p>
      In 2019-20 AGL emitted 42,227,180 tonnes of CO2, equivalent to 21,241,036 cars on the road per year. That's nearly one extra car for every person in Australia. 
      </p>
      <h3>Energy Australia</h3>
      
      
      <p>
      Energy Australia emitted 18,696,756 tonnes of CO2 in 2019-20. This is roughly equivalent to 9,404,806 cars on the road per year.
      </p>
      <h3>Origin Energy</h3>
      
      
      <p>
      Origin Energy emitted 15,997,984 tonnes of CO2 in 2019-20, roughly 8,047,275 cars per year.
      </p>
      <h3>Alinta Energy</h3>
      
      
      <p>
      Alinta produces around 1,046,806 tonnes of CO2 per year from fossil fuel energy generation. This is equivalent to about 526,562 cars on the road per year.
      </p>
      <h3>All the carbon emissions together</h3>
      
      
      <p>
      If we sum up all the emissions of these four polluters together, it would be the equivalent of 39,219,679 cars on the road every year. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Now to think, if Australia made its electricity from carbon-neutral sources, it would significantly impact global warming. Per capita, each of us emits several cars worth of CO2 every year. A few minor changes in our energy provider could substantially affect our carbon emissions.
      </p>
      <h2>Creating green energy through rooftop solar</h2>
      
      
      <p>
      If you live in a home, another solution to going green is considering solar energy for your roof. While not for everyone, there are some simple calculations you can make to decide if its right for you.
      </p>
      <p>
      If your home is consuming more than 10 kWh of energy a day (you should be able to find out how much you consume per day on your energy bill), then you could consider installing solar on your rooftop.
      </p>
      <p>
      There are numerous ways to purchase, finance, install and operate solar on your rooftop. Two companies worth checking out for installing solar are:
      </p>
      <h3><a href="https://brighte.com.au/homeowners/">Brighte</a></h3>
      
      
      <p>
      Brighte offers financing options for your solar installation, so you can have zero-down loans with low-interest payback options for your solar system. They also have a list of vetted and certified solar installers, so there is more confidence in getting a good service.
      </p>
      <h3><a href="https://nrn.com.au/residential/">National Renewable Network</a></h3>
      
      
      <p>
      The NRN installs solar on your roof free of cost, but you then have to use their partnered energy providers. The good news is they partner with green companies like Diamond Energy and Energy Locals and not the big polluters.
      </p>
      <p>
      In the first year, you will pay a higher energy bill to pay off the solar system, but overall the savings over several years will be way more if you bought your own solar system.
      </p>
      <h2>How to find the greenest energy for you</h2>
      
      
      <p>
      Now it is easier than ever to have a significant impact on turning the energy in your home into green energy.
      </p>
      <p>
      Check out our <a href="https://solvingzero.com/compare-electricity-provider/index.html">green electricity provider list</a> to find the best energy provider that suits your needs.
      </p>
      <p>
      Depending on what state and even town you are in, each energy provider's prices can vary significantly. Don't throw darts in a dark room. Make an informed decision on your electricity provider.
