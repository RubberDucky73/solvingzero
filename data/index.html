        <h1>How do we rate each energy retailer?</h1>
        <p>
        We have three key criteria for each energy retailer, their green rating, affordability, and trustworthiness. Each criteria has multiple data points used to create a single one out of five rating for that category. This is a short explanation of how each of these ratings is created and what data is being used to inform these decisions. 
        </p>
        <h2>The Solving Zero Green Rating</h2>
        <p>The green rating for energy retailers combines quantitative and more qualitative data points brought together. Together we look at around seven to eight criteria depending on the availability of the information. </p>
        <p>
        We do not penalise companies if we cannot source the complete data unless it seems like an absence of information is being used to avoid unpleasant truths. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The primary criteria that go into the green rating are:
        </p>
        <ul>
        
        <li>Does the energy retailer offer carbon-neutral energy plans by default or at least as an option?
        
        <li>Does the company invest or support the use of fossil fuels, this includes all forms of coal and natural gas as a means for energy production?
        
        <li>Do any of the parent or sister companies invest in or support the use of fossil fuels?
        
        <li>Is GreenPower being offered, at what percentage levels of energy consumption? Some companies only offer maximums of 10 or 20%
        
        <li>Does the energy retailer offer green programs or incentives to the consumer that can encourage the use of green energy or less fossil fuel energy? Programs like: 
        <ul>
         
        <li>Community energy sharing locally to have less dependence on the grid energy
         
        <li>Offering battery tariffs to pay customers for the use of the energy stored in their home batteries when needed
         
        <li>EV charging programs for consumers who have an EV and can pay less at night for their power when their car is charging
         
        <li>Demand response to let consumers know when the grid is at its highest demand and most likely using the most fossil fuels
        </li> 
        </ul>
        
        <li>Are the base rates for energy from the grid the same for consumers with solar as those without? Some companies charge more for grid energy to solar users in an attempt to gain back the money they credit for solar feed-in tariffs.
        
        <li>In some cases, at what price point are these programs being offered for the above criteria? (only if it’s astronomically expensive or cheap is this considered here)
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Solving Zero Affordability Rating</h2>
        
        
        <p>
        The affordability rating for energy retailers is a primarily quantitative comparison for around twelve key criteria. We also cite government regulatory bodies that publish reports about the energy retail industry and compare retailers’ pricing and plans. A culmination of all of these criteria gives us our final affordability rating.
        </p>
        <p>
        Like the other ratings, a high rating of five out of five means that the retailer is the most affordable. Inversely a rating of one out of five means the retailer is the most expensive among the competition. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The affordability ratings are on a scale that begins with the cheapest retailer and ends with the most expensive. Since there are so energy providers in Australia, this provides a large enough spectrum to create an average relative price. Removing the need for a predetermined price point that identifies a plan as being relatively affordable or expensive. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Further to the above point, every home uses a different amount of energy at other times of the day. The affordability criteria were chosen to best average each energy retailer’s general prices without getting bogged down in hypothetical scenarios of trying to optimise the unique offerings of one plan over another.  
        </p>
        <p>
        The key criteria that are used to determine the affordability rating are:
        </p>
        <ul>
        
        <li>How has the Essential Services Commission ranked the pricing of the energy retailer? The ESC released a report on energy retailer pricing <a href="https://www.esc.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Victorian-Energy-Market%20Report-2021-20211130_0.pdf">here.</a> 
        
        <li>The above ESC report provides the median pricing of energy retailers and the range of pricing that their customers pay, from the lowest to the highest. 
        
        <li>The legally required Fact Sheets that every energy provider has to provide, on these fact sheets you can find: 
        <ul>
         
        <li>Time-of-use charges, which include the off-peak and peak pricing for one kWh of energy 
         
        <li>Single-rate pricing if instead its just one set price for one kWh of energy
         
        <li>Every fact sheet for every plan also has an estimated yearly cost. The estimated costs are calculated at different energy consumption levels, 7.2 kWh, 11.8 kWh and 15.5 kWh per day (singles, couples and families)
         
        <li>The daily charge, which is what retailers charge for just being your retailer every day
         
        <li>Control load charges, which are special costs associated with some homes that have special energy needs for hot water heaters and other energy-intensive appliances
        </li> 
        </ul>
        
        <li>Does the energy retailer charge a subscription fee on top of your usual energy bill? If so, how expensive is it?
        
        <li>Their pricing for purchasing GreenPower and how much they credit for solar feed-in tariffs
        
        <li>How transparent is their pricing overall, is it easy to find all the needed information or do we have to dig through their site to find the Fact Sheets
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Solving Zero Trustworthiness Rating</h2>
        
        
        <p>
        The trust rating is primarily an averaging of customer reviews where available. Several sites provide user reviews of energy retailers and, for the most part, are consistent site to site. We combine all of these sites into one final average to create the customer review average. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Additionally, various government bodies oversee energy retailers and their operations. Often, these regulatory bodies will undertake compliance action against the retailers for a spectrum of offences and rule-breaking. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The two above key criteria contribute a large portion to the trustworthiness, including those here are the key criteria to consider:
        </p>
        <ul>
        
        <li>A total averaging of all online reviews for the retailer, special care is taken to make sure no reviews look bought or fake
        
        <li>Various sites conduct their own surveys of customers and create their own averages. They also report on the number of complaints filed as a proportion of the total customer base for a specific retailer
        
        <li>The number of compliance actions and fines taken up against a retailer
        
        <li>The magnitude and nature of the offences that the retailer is found guilty of, how severe it is for the retailer and their customers
