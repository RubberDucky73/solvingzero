                GloBird is one of the most affordable retailers in Victoria with some of the lowest prices for all energy consumption levels (singles, couples, families). Unfortunately they have almost no green programs or incentives other than a few solar plans, though their solar feed-in tariff is the legally required minimum. We would suggest looking at ReAmped Energy if you are trying to find an affordable retailer.

Also much like GloBird this retailer has virtually no green programs or incentives beyond the basic legally required minimum. If you're looking for a trustworthy retailer we suggest Discover Energy.
